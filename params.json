Furthermore, it implements a few more advanced trackers to handle complicated situations. However, it seems that it lacks an image noise filter (_noise filter is now supported in the latest version_).\r\n\r\n* Particle Identification and Tracking: Particle Identification and Tracking (http://tacaswell.github.io/tracking/html/)\r\nThis is an implementation in `C++` of the particle tracking algorithms developed by Croker and Grier.\r\n\r\n* [`Matlab` Particle Tracking](http://site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/)\r\n\r\n* [circletracking](https://github.com/caspervdw/circletracking): `python` toolkits for tracking circles and ellipses in 2D or 3D images\r\n\r\n* [EllipsoidFit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/EllipsoidFit) can handle 3D ellipsoid\r\n\r\n* [Rectangle_fit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/Rectangle_fit) can handle rod\r\n\r\n* [TubeTK](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/TubeTK) is an open-source toolkit for the segmentation, registration, and analysis of tubes and surfaces in images, developed by Kitware, Inc.\r\n\r\n* [MathieuLeocmach/colloids](https://github.com/MathieuLeocmach/colloids) is a `C++` and `python` library to process both experimental and simulation data of colloidal particles. The main features are particle tracking from confocal microscopy images and analysis of local structure and dynamics of particles (from simulations or experiments).\r\n * [feature particles with multiscale sizes](https://github.com/MathieuLeocmach/colloids/blob/master/python/colloids/notebooks/Multiscale.ipynb) (`jupyter-notebook`)\r\n * [Colloid+polymer mixture phase diagram obtained from free volume theory](https://github.com/MathieuLeocmach/colloids/blob/master/python/colloids/notebooks/phase%20diagram.ipynb) (`jupyter-notebook`)\r\n\r\n* Some comments and info on 2D feature finding: \r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-beam/scikit-beam/wiki/2-D-Feature-Finding\r\n\r\n* Hough transform (1972), which started out as a technique to detect lines in image, has been generalized and extended to detect curves in 2D and 3D. It has been implemented in [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Movie/Image\r\n* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for making movies, and converting movie to images. It is a cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library. `h.264` encoder is not included in this library. Hence if h.264 is the desired format, it is necessary to install `x264` and compile `ffmpeg` with x264 enabled.\r\nHere is an example to use `ffmpeg` (10 fps, bitrate: 1MB/s) in `bash` in `Linux`\r\n ```\r\n ffmpeg -i figs/%04d.png -vcodec mpeg4 -r 10 -b:v 1M output.avi\r\n ```\r\n\r\n* html files can embed videos, so that one can use browser to show movie. Media formats supported by HTML (Browser compatibility) should be\r\n  * Theora and Vorbis in Ogg\r\n  * H.264 and MP3 in MP4\r\n  * H.264 and AAC in MP4\r\n  * WebM\r\n\r\n* In PowerPoint 2013 and later, for the best video playback experience, it is recommended to use .mp4 files encoded with H.264 video (a.k.a. MPEG-4 AVC) and AAC audio. For audio, use .m4a files encoded with AAC audio. \r\n\r\n* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/): Convert, Edit, Or Compose Bitmap Images\r\n\r\n* `import` tool from `ImageMagick` can be used to capture the screenshot. Run\r\n ```\r\n import screenshot.png\r\n ```\r\n and select the window you want to capture or select a region by pressing the left mouse button and dragging.\r\n Ref: http://askubuntu.com/questions/194427/what-is-the-terminal-command-to-take-a-screenshot\r\n\r\n* [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org/) is professional quality vector graphics software which runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows desktop computers. It can be used to extract and edit figures from scientific papers in PDF format. Its default format is SVG. To convert pdf figures to SVG, one can use `pdftocairo` which has been installed on most Linux computers:\r\n ```\r\n pdftocairo -svg input.pdf\r\n ```\r\n\r\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi shows the Unicode for different forms of greek letter phi. The most important one is `U+03D5`, which shows the phi letter similar to the latex font, commonly used in math and technical contexts.\r\n\r\n* [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims): Python Image Sequence: Load video and sequential images in many formats with a simple, consistent interface. It has the same authors as `trackpy`.\r\n\r\n* [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy)\r\nis a `Python` module for video editing. It can read and write all the most common audio and video formats, including GIF, and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux\r\n\r\n* [neural-enhance](https://github.com/alexjc/neural-enhance) Super Resolution for images using deep learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Big data visualization\r\n* [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) is a `python` project which targets browser-based graphics, and recent releases are beginning to do big data in the browser the right way.\r\n\r\n* [VisPy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) is another effort to provide easy visualization of large datasets with `python`. It is based on `OpenGL`, with plans to add a `WebGL` backend.\r\n\r\n* [mpld3](https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3) brings together `Matplotlib`, the popular `Python`-based graphing library, and `D3js`, the popular Javascript library for creating interactive data,  which can output SVG files. The library may require a little knowledge on javascript to enable flexible functions. It provides an interactive way to data visualization, rather than aiming on big data. d3.js gallery: https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery. An example can be found: Visualizing MBTA Data: http://mbtaviz.github.io/\r\n\r\n* [OVITO](http://ovito.org/) is a scientific visualization and analysis software for atomistic simulation data developed by Alexander Stukowski at Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany. It can be also used to visualize experimental data if the data is saved as the one of the following formats: LAMMPS, XYZ, IMD, CFG, POSCAR, AMBER/NetCDF, PDB, GSD/HOOMD, and VTK. See the description of those formats: http://ovito.org/manual/usage.import.html\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/jbmouret/matplotlib_for_papers\r\nuses `matplotlib` to plot statistical figures. Good example for box plot, Stars (statistical significance).\r\n\r\n* [pubplot](https://github.com/fengwangPhysics/pubplot) is a `python` module for making publication-quality figures with `matplotlib`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Crystal defect identification\r\n* [OVITO](http://ovito.org/) implemented dislocation detection (DXA).\r\n\r\n* [BiDef](https://github.com/mskarlin/BiDef) is a python package using supervised machine learning for crystal defect identification. See details in the author's paper. It also seems that the package has something to do with `ovito`.\r\n\r\n* [Atoman](https://github.com/chrisdjscott/Atoman) provides a python wrapper (written by `C` extension) on `voro++`, and algorithms to detect point defects by voronoi.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thesis\r\n* [Theses from Arjun G.

It is useful to obtain nearest neighbors with an O(log n) complexity. `scipy.spatial.KDTree` and `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` are two very fast implementations in python and C. (https://github.com/prody/ProDy/tree/master/prody/kdtree) has an implementation of kd-tree which can handle periodic boundary condition. A more general algorithm is `cover tree` which can handle any distance metric in arbitrary high dimensional space. There are some C++ cover-tree implementations on github. The speed of the algorithm is very fast: one of implementations claimed that it takes 250 seconds for inserting 10^6 1000-dimensional vectors, and achieves 300 queries per second.\r\n\r\n* [libccd](https://github.com/danfis/libccd) is a library for collision detection between two convex shapes.\r\n\r\n* [NVT-GJK](https://github.com/Grieverheart/NVT-GJK) NVT-MC Hard Particle Simulation\r\n\r\n* [multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)](https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar) estimating expectations and free energy differences.
