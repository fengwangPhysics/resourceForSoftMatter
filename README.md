## particle tracking
* [trackpy](https://github.com/ronojoy/trackpy)
provides a mature version of `python` particle tracking implementation of the famous `IDL` tracking code from John Crocker and David Grier (www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/). Furthermore, it implements a few more advanced trackers to handle complicated situations. However, it seems that it lacks an image noise filter.
* Particle Identification and Tracking: Particle Identification and Tracking (tacaswell.github.io/tracking/html/)
This is an implementation in `c++` of the particle tracking algorithms developed by Croker and Grier.

* `Matlab` Particle Tracking (site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/)

* [circletracking](https://github.com/caspervdw/circletracking): `python` tookits for tracking circles and ellipses in 2D or 3D images

* [EllipsoidFit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/EllipsoidFit) can handle 3D ellipsoid

* [Rectangle_fit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/Rectangle_fit) can handle rod

* [TubeTK](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/TubeTK) is an open-source toolkit for the segmentation, registration, and analysis of tubes and surfaces in images, developed by Kitware, Inc.

* [MathieuLeocmach/colloids](https://github.com/MathieuLeocmach/colloids) is a `C++` and `python` library to process both experimental and simulation data of colloidal particles. The main features are particle tracking from confocal microscopy images and analysis of local structure and dynamics of particles (from simulations or experiments).

## movie/image
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for making movies, and converting movie to images. It is a cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library.

* html files can embed videos, so that one can use browser to show movie. Media formats supported by HTML (Browser compatibility) should be
  * Theora and Vorbis in Ogg
  * H.264 and MP3 in MP4
  * H.264 and AAC in MP4
  * WebM

* ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org/): Convert, Edit, Or Compose Bitmap Images

* [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org/) is professional quality vector graphics software which runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows desktop computers. It can be used to extract and edit figures from scientific papers in PDF format. Its default format is SVG. To convert pdf figures to SVG, one can use `pdftocairo` which has been installed on most Linux computers:
 ```
$ pdftocairo -svg input.pdf
 ```
* [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims): Python Image Sequence: Load video and sequential images in many formats with a simple, consistent interface.

## Big data visualization
* [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) is a `python` project which targets browser-based graphics, and recent releases are beginning to do big data in the browser the right way. 
* [VisPy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) is another effort to provide easy visualization of large datasets with `python`. It is based on `OpenGL`, with plans to add a `WebGL` backend.
* [mpld3](https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3) brings together `Matplotlib`, the popular `Python`-based graphing library, and `D3js`, the popular Javascript library for creating interactive data,  which can output SVG files. The library may require a little knowledge on javascript to enable flexible functions. It provides an interactive way to data visualization, rather than aiming on big data. d3.js gallery: https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery. An example can be found: Visualizing MBTA Data: http://mbtaviz.github.io/

## Crystal defect identification
* [BiDef](https://github.com/mskarlin/BiDef]) is a python package using supervised machine learning for crystal defect identification. See details in the author's paper. It also seems that the package has something to do with `ovito`.
* [Atoman](https://github.com/chrisdjscott/Atoman) provides a python wrapper (written by C extension) on voro++, and algorithms to detect point defects by voronoi.

## Thesis
* W.L. Miller's thesis (https://github.com/wlmiller/thesis): Janus particles and aspherical particles MD simulation
* This thesis (https://github.com/jeffschulte/dissertation/blob/master/general_notes.tex) gives a note on FMT of hard spheres.

## Online learning materials
* [SklogWiki](http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Main_Page) is an open-edit encyclopedia dedicated to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, especially that of simple liquids, complex fluids, and soft condensed matter.

## Latex and PDF files
* [Latex Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a very good start point to learn latex.

* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an online `LaTeX` and Rich Text collaborative writing and publishing tool that makes the whole process of writing, editing and publishing scientific documents much quicker and easier. 

* [Overleaf templates](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/): Start your projects with quality LaTeX templates for journals, CVs, resumes, papers, presentations, assignments, letters, project reports, and more. 

* [zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero) is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share your research sources. It is a useful reference manager which can export `bibtex`.

* merge PDF files:
 * `pdfunite` is a part of poppler, however, someone pointed out that the output.pdf may be very large while `gs` packs a small size.
 ```
$ pdfunite in1.pdf in2.pdf out.pdf
 ```
 * use `gs`
 ```
$ gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=out.pdf in1.pdf in2.pdf
 ```

## Useful algorithms
* [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. It is useful to obtain nearest neighbors with an O(log n) complexity. `scipy.spatial.KDTree` and `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` are two very fast implementations in python and C. (https://github.com/prody/ProDy/tree/master/prody/kdtree) has an implementation of kd-tree which can handle periodic boundary condition. A more general algorithm is `cover tree` which can handle any distance metric in arbitary high dimensional space. There are some C++ cover-tree implementations on github. The speed of the algorithm is very fast: one of implementations claimed that it takes 250 seconds for inserting 10^6 1000-dimensional vectors, and achieves 300 queries per second.
