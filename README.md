## particle tracking
* [trackpy](https://github.com/ronojoy/trackpy)
provides a mature version of `python` particle tracking implementation of the famous `IDL` tracking code from John Crocker and David Grier (www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/). Furthermore, it implements a few more advanced trackers to handle complicated situations.
* Particle Identification and Tracking: Particle Identification and Tracking (tacaswell.github.io/tracking/html/)
This is an implementation in c++ of the particle tracking algorithms developed by Croker and Grier.

* Matlab Particle Tracking (site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/)

* [circletracking](https://github.com/caspervdw/circletracking): python tookits for tracking circles and ellipses in 2D or 3D images

* [EllipsoidFit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/EllipsoidFit) can handle 3D ellipsoid

* [Rectangle_fit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/Rectangle_fit) can handle rod

## movie/image
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for making movies, and converting movie to images. It is a cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library.

*  ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org/): Convert, Edit, Or Compose Bitmap Images
