## particle tracking
* [trackpy](https://github.com/ronojoy/trackpy)
provides a mature version of `python` particle tracking implementation of the famous `IDL` tracking code from John Crocker and David Grier (www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/). Furthermore, it implements a few more advanced trackers to handle complicated situations.
* Particle Identification and Tracking: Particle Identification and Tracking (tacaswell.github.io/tracking/html/)
This is an implementation in `c++` of the particle tracking algorithms developed by Croker and Grier.

* `Matlab` Particle Tracking (site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/)

* [circletracking](https://github.com/caspervdw/circletracking): `python` tookits for tracking circles and ellipses in 2D or 3D images

* [EllipsoidFit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/EllipsoidFit) can handle 3D ellipsoid

* [Rectangle_fit](https://github.com/harukihirasawa/Rectangle_fit) can handle rod

## movie/image
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for making movies, and converting movie to images. It is a cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec - the leading audio/video codec library.

* ImageMagick (www.imagemagick.org/): Convert, Edit, Or Compose Bitmap Images

* [Inkscape](https://www.inkscape.org/) is professional quality vector graphics software which runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows desktop computers. It can be used to extract and edit figures from scientific papers in PDF format. Its default format is SVG. To convert pdf figures to SVG, one can use `pdftocairo` which has been installed on most Linux computers:
```
$ pdftocairo -svg input.pdf
```
